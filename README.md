## EarthGaurd : 2023 PAT
It is important that we as a society make an effort towards cleaning our environment but a
lot of individuals don’t know where to begin. A majority of people are demotivated into
tidying up the environment because of the friction involved in volunteering to cleaning the
surrounding. There are a lot of unknown geographical areas that have a sufficient level of
pollution even though they’re noticed by people, there is no straightforward way of
notifying society of such places so that action can be taken.

The solution, an application that will connect people with the sole aim of eradicating
pollution within the community. A hub where environmentally aware people come together
to raise awareness on issues causing climate change and being able to come together to
tackle them. It will be a centralised platform for those that are passionate about the
environment or simply want to lend a helping hand in making their world a better place.

## Tennis Knockout Admin System : 2022 PAT
Ineffecient and crude methods are often used during these competitions for
planning, keeping track of scores and determining the placement of
participants according to how they scored. Pen and paper, sometimes a
calculator, are the most common tools used to do the above and when you
scale the competition(s) up you notice that it becomes tedious as you are
wasting time and resources.

I’m proposing that the proccess of planning and overseeing a competition can
be made much more efficient and effective through the use of an application.
The application will cater for tennis singles/doubles knock-out competitions.
With it tournament organizers will be able to plan, track and analyse a
tournament with the application. Tournaments will also be recorded into a
database so that they can be retrieved easily if the need arises. This will help
torunament organizers keep track of their tournaments and cut some costs as
less physical resources will be used.
